## November 5th

**Goal:** Placing a raincloud next to a sapling should transform the sapling into a sunflower and remove the raincloud from the board.

**Current (Unsuccessful) Approach:** Iterate over each tile and check if that tile needs to be removed because of a rule, or if it should change to something else because of a rule. Removal is a true/false result but changes is a list! As checking for changes involves iterating over each rule, with different rules possibly causing a different change.

Resolving changes in this way seems wrong.. and hard to animate. It feels like I need to combine removals and transforms into one change, and generate a list of those changes, to animate one after the other?

Ok, I think the problem is the rules themselves. This is what I'm working with:

```
{:type :adj
 :base "🌱"
 :adj "🌧️"
 :base-to "🌻"
 :consume-adj true}
```

What the heck does that even mean? I think I might have just bashed this out as an idea a while back and it just stuck around.

A more flexible rule might be this:

```
[["🌱" "🌧️"] ["🌻" nil]]
```

The whole game can be a bunch of replacement effects right? Here's a render of the new rule:

**New Approach:** Rules are tile replacements, basically string -> string. Generate a list of replacements to apply to the board sequentially. Animate the replacements.

Following paths?

```
{:rule [["🔥" "🌱" "🌧️"] [nil "🌻" nil ]]
 :total-steps 3
 :paths #{
          {:direction [0 1] :tiles [["🔥" -2 0 false ]] :walking? false }
          {:direction [1 0]
           :tiles [["🔥" -2 0 false ]
                   ["🌱" -1 0 true ]
                   ["🌧️" 0 0 true ]]
           :walking? false }
          {:direction [0 -1] :tiles [["🔥" -2 0 false ]] :walking? false }
          {:direction [-1 0] :tiles [["🔥" -2 0 false ]] :walking? false }}}
```
